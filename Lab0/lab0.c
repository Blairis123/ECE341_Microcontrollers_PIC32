/* no_swap FUNCTION DESCRIPTION ********************************************
 * SYNTAX:          void no_swap(int x, int y)
 * KEYWORDS:        swap, exchange, pass by value
 * DESCRIPTION:     This function swaps the values in variables x and y. Since
 *                  the variables are passed by value, the results are lost once
 *                  the program execution returns from this function.
 * PARAMETER1:      first integer value
 * PARAMETER2:      second integer value
 * RETURN VALUE:    None.
 *
 * NOTES:           Variables passed by value in the argument list are local
 *                  considered to be variables. Variables declared inside the
 *                  function are also local variables provided they are not
 *                  declared as static.

 * DESCRIPTION:     This function swaps the values of variables whose address are
 *                  passed as x and y. Since the variables are passed by reference,
 *                  the results are not lost once the function is done.
 * PARAMETER1:      first integer value
 * PARAMETER2:      second integer value
 * RETURN VALUE:    Sum of x and y.
 *
 * NOTES:       Variables that are passed by reference appear in the MPLAB
 *              locals window. Local variables that are declared as static
 *              can be viewed in the watch window.
